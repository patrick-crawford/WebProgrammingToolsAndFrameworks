Additionally, we can execute a specific block of code right when the error is encountered; in this case we output "uh oh, an error occurred!". This is not very useful to help us debug the error, but it better than having the program crash and at least we know that an error did indeed occur. If we wish to obtain additional information about the error, we can make use of some of the properties / methods of the ',(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"strong",href:"https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v19/errors/#class-error"},"Error")),' object that was thrown as an exception and caught in our "catch" block. For example, we can alter the code to use the "message" property of the caught exception (ex) to display a more helpful error:'),(0,r.kt)("pre",null,(0,r.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-js"},"const PI = 3.14159;\n\nconsole.log('trying to change PI!');\n\ntry {\n  PI = 99;\n} catch (ex) {\n  console.log(`uh oh, an error occurred: ${ex.message}`);\n  // outputs: uh oh, an error occurred: Assignment to constant variable.\n}\n\nconsole.log(`Alas, it cannot be done, PI remains: ${PI}`);\n")),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"By utilizing properties such as ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v19/errors/#errormessage"},"Error.message")," & ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v19/errors/#errorstack"},"Error.stack"),", we can gain further insight to exactly what went wrong and we can either refactor our code to remedy the error, or acknowledge that the error will happen and handle it gracefully."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'Lastly, if we have some code that we would like to execute regardless of whether or not the code in our "try" block is successful, we can use a "finally" block:'),(0,r.kt)("pre",null,(0,r.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-js"},"const PI = 3.14159;\n\nconsole.log('trying to change PI!');\n\ntry {\n  PI = 99;\n} catch (ex) {\n  console.log(`uh oh, an error occurred: ${ex.message}`);\n  // outputs: uh oh, an error occurred: Assignment to constant variable.\n} finally {\n  console.log('always execute code in this block');\n}\n\nconsole.log(`Alas, it cannot be done, PI remains: ${PI}`);\n")),(0,r.kt)("h3",{id:"throwing-errors"},"Throwing Errors"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Now that we know how to correctly handle errors that have been thrown by the Node.js runtime environment or by other code / modules included in our solutions, why don't we try throwing our ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"own exceptions"),"?

In the above example, we check if our second parameter (y) is zero (0) and rather than trying to do the division, we immediately throw a custom error with the message "Division by Zero!".
